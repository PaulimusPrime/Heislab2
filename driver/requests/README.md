# requests Package

The `requests` package handles the request management and deterministic decision-making logic for an elevator system. It determines how the elevator should respond to requests based on its current state, direction, and queued requests.

## Overview
This package provides functions to:
- Determine if there are requests above, below, or at the current floor.
- Decide the appropriate movement direction and behavior.
- Determine whether the elevator should stop at a floor.
- Manage request clearing logic.
