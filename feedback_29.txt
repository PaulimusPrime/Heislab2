1The code needs to be altered in several Places if one wants to add more than 3 elevators and 4 floors. Consider adding a config file where all of these variables are kept and called when used in the program. Now everything is explicitly stated With a value each time. Which could cause issues and difficulty to maintain the code.
2Consider changing the default UDP ports used in the handout code as to avoid receiving Messages from other Groups that uses these default ports.
3The Three functions defined below the main loop should be moved to a different file as to make Your program more readable and scalable. 
4Dont understand the for loop at the bottom of distribution it is not inside a function and is not being run, maybe misplaced???
5Why is there a separate main loop in the assigner.go file???
6The code is relatively easy to follow and has a logical flow. It has its flaws but it is certainly on the right track of what we, with our Limited understanding, view as a good solution.
